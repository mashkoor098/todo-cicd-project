# üöÄ **CI/CD Pipeline Project**

This repository demonstrates the integration of **Jenkins** with **GitHub** to set up a fully automated **CI/CD pipeline**. The pipeline automatically builds, tests, and deploys code whenever changes are pushed to GitHub. **Personal Access Tokens (PAT)** are used for secure communication between GitHub and Jenkins.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack**

- **CI/CD Tools**:
  - **Jenkins**: For continuous integration and continuous delivery. Jenkins automates the process of building, testing, and deploying your code.
  - **GitHub**: Integrated with Jenkins to trigger builds via **GitHub Webhooks** and **Personal Access Tokens** (PAT) for secure authentication.

- **Authentication**:
  - **Personal Access Tokens (PAT)**: Secure method for authenticating GitHub to Jenkins, ensuring safe communication and access between the two.

- **Pipeline**:
  - **CI/CD Pipeline**: Jenkins pipeline to automatically build, test, and deploy code when changes are pushed to GitHub. It ensures a continuous delivery cycle and fast deployments.
